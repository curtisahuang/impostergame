# oddballgame

Currently deployed on https://oddballgame.netlify.app/

Here the basic gameplay loop:

    Everyone is going to be given a word.
    One person's word is going to be different.
    The words are going to be similar.
    Everyone says a true statement about their word.
    All the players will vote to execute someone.
    The oddball wins if they are one of the last players.
    The group wins if they can identify the oddball.
    Have fun!

Current wordbank is Japan-focused. US, UK, and Hong Kong wordbanks to be updated.

If there are any unknown words to the players, hide all player words and generate new words.

Have fun!
